The earliest models were derived from Second Committee–era mineral surveying lasers. An initial beam flash-vaporizes the target’s outer layer and the plasma bloom is instantly analyzed for material density and structural composition, following which the needlebeam fires a focused, highintensity pulsed beam tuned to defeat heavy armor. Performance against softer targets is significantly reduced, however, as excessive material ablation disrupts the secondary beam before an optimal effect can be achieved.",

Armory ontologisticians and engineers isolated and emphasized endemic protocols that could be exploited for tactical advantage.<br>Over numerous iterations and lifecycles, NOAH Prime displayed a high level of adaptability in multiple-variable geospatial problems. A proclivity toward crisis management and multi-actor tracking led to NOAH’s pairing with the Armory’s ENCLAVE-Pattern Support Shield. By networking a series of jet-assist mobility drones carrying an ENCLAVE generator, monitored and controlled by a NOAH clone, Think Tank was able to create an unparalleled personal shielding system: the Diluvian Ark, a miniaturized cluster-shield system unique to the NOAH NHP.<br>Using the Diluvian Ark, NOAH is able to intercept incoming kinetics – and even redirect projectiles back to their source – with stunning accuracy.",

The resulting parasubjectivity, OSIRIS, remains one of the few new prime NHPs developed to date.<br>OSIRIS proved far more capable than the Union Science Bureau’s most imaginative blue-sky predictions. Where INSTINCT’s Others demonstrated tendencies toward paracausal entropic manifestation in real space, OSIRIS displayed a true mastery of entropic manifestation and a predicted growth model that would – eventually – allow them to fundamentally reject conventional interpretations of information permanence. In essence: unrestrained and allowed to develop as USB’s data indicated, OSIRIS Prime would have the capacity to delete what we perceive to be reality.<br>Fortunately, successful application of the Mondragon Axiomatic resulted in the prompt capture and shackling of the new NHP. OSIRIS Prime’s subjectivity became the focus of a lengthy cultivation project to bring OSIRIS to their modern state. Even still, most OSIRIS clones find a route toward becoming aware of their ultimate potential and often interpellate as ruler or deity analogs. End-users are advised to interact with them in this framing.<br>Modern OSIRIS-class NHPs trend aggressive, with a high autonomy drive and loyalty predicated on a transactional relationship. Pilots seeking partnership with an OSIRIS are advised to cycle their units on an accelerated schedule and to maintain strict editorial oversight of its catalytic interpellator.Pilots using OSIRIS-class NHPs often report out-of-parameter conversations with the NHP that touch on themes of new creation and reformation. Psychological evaluations of the same pilots show emotional patterns consistent with loneliness, homesickness, and desperation, along with verbiage indicating a desire for seeking, fulfillment, and associated feelings.<br>In combat, OSIRIS clones regard themselves as autonomous even as they fulfill their user’s orders.
